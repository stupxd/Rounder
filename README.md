Whenever you gain/lose money with fractional value, randomly round it to an integer (whole) value.

Fractional value is used as a chance to increase absolute value by 1.

0.5 = 50% chance,

0.1 = 10% chance,

etc.


### Example:

`+1.1` will round up to `+2` 10% of the times, otherwise it will round down to `+1`.
